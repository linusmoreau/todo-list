# My To-Do List

## Or: How I learned to stop worrying and keep track of things

A to-do list tailor-made for me, myself, and I. The completed application should keep track of various things I should
get to (along with lighter stuff to brighten the day), while also maintaining various metrics about it for easier
digestion and perhaps retroactive perusal.

The application will keep track of:
- Assignments (and due dates)
- Examination dates
- Inspiration quotes
- Movie watch list
- Miscellaneous tasks

I'm making this project as an upgrade to my current minimalist method of maintaining my to-dos 
(it is *definitely not* just a .txt file). Having a more formalized system for keeping track of my tasks
would be a real benefit to **everything**.
